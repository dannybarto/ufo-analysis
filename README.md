# UFOs

## Project Overview
We are creating a dynamic webpage and table that affords users the opportunity to enter various criteria in order to obtain specific information regarding UFO sightings.\
Users can input the following paremeters to filter and customize the UFO sightings data: event date, city, state, country and shape. 

## Data Sources
- [UFO Sightings Data](https://github.com/dannybarto/ufo-analysis/blob/main/static/js/data.js)
- [Functionality](https://github.com/dannybarto/ufo-analysis/blob/main/static/js/app_1.js)

## Information About the Webpage and Search Parameters

### UFO Sightings webpage
[The Truth is Out There]<a href="https://dannybarto.github.io/" target="_blank">dannybarto.github.io</a>

### Search Criteria Procedures

## Summary of Analysis

- The fields should clearly denote that the default data in the search fields is only for example
- The date field should have the date format M/DD/YYYY instead of an example date
- The remaining fields should consist of drop down lists to make things simpler 
- The Navbar at the top left needs to be highlighted as a functional link
- It's a good tool for researching UFO sightings but needs to become more user friendly per examples above
